I have synesthesia, which means I see numbers as colors. My therapist says I'm depressed, but I think I just see everything in 2's. Get it? Because 2 is blue... I'm blue... I should have led with the color part. This is why I failed at being a math teacher. "Okay class, who can solve for X?" "It's clearly purple." "That's... that's not even wrong in the right way."
